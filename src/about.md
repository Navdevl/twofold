We're Naveen and Rachel, and this is our shared journal of places we love.

Twofold started as a simple idea: keep track of the cafes, restaurants, and stays that made us want to come back. Not just once, but again and again. These are the places where we've had great conversations, celebrated small wins, found comfort on hard days, or simply enjoyed a perfect cup of coffee.

This isn't a review site. We're not trying to be comprehensive or objective. These are personal notes — places that mean something to us, captured so we remember why we kept returning.

Thanks for visiting.
