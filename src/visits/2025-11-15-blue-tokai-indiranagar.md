Ducked in to escape the sudden November rain. Ended up staying for three hours with our laptops. The Attikan Estate pour-over was particularly good today — notes of chocolate and orange that lingered beautifully.

Shared a slice of their banana bread. The rain on the windows made everything feel extra cozy.
