A Bangalore institution since 1924. MTR is where we come for the most authentic South Indian breakfast experience. The original Lalbagh Road location has that old-world charm that newer branches can't quite replicate.

Their rava idli was invented here, and it remains the gold standard. The filter coffee is strong and perfect. Be prepared to queue on weekends — it's worth the wait.
