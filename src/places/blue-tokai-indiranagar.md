Our go-to spot for specialty coffee in Bangalore. The Indiranagar outlet has a cozy atmosphere with exposed brick walls and plenty of natural light. Their single-origin pour-overs are exceptional, and the baristas really know their craft.

The space gets busy on weekends but remains a perfect weekday work spot. We love their seasonal specials and always grab a bag of beans to take home.
